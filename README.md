# android-efi

android-efi is a simple x86 EFI bootloader for Androidâ„¢ boot images.
It accepts the partition GUID and/or path of an Android boot image on the
command line, loads the kernel, ramdisk and command line and finally hands over
control to the kernel.

## Building
android-efi is built with [Meson]:

```
meson . build
ninja -C build
```

## Usage
Run `android.efi` from an UEFI Shell using the partition UUID and/or the path
to the boot image.

Alternatively, with [systemd-boot]:

```
title    Android
efi      /android.efi
options  normal 80868086-8086-8086-8086-000000000100
```

```
title    Recovery
efi      /android.efi
options  recovery 80868086-8086-8086-8086-000000000101
```

In this case, the first argument is ignored because this would be `android.efi`
when using the application in an UEFI shell.

### Options
- Boot from a boot image partition:

  ```
  80868086-8086-8086-8086-000000000100
  ```

- Boot from a boot image file on the EFI system partition:

  ```
  /boot.img
  ```

- Boot from a boot image file on another partition (must be FAT32, or otherwise
  supported by an UEFI driver).
  
  ```
  80868086-8086-8086-8086-000000000007/boot.img
  ```
